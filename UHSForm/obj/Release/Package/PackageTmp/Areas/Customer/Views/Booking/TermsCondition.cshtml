                                    these Terms, they must cease all access and usage of the Platform immediately. The Customer’s
                                    continued use of the Platform, including logging into their account, initiating service
                                    requests, or browsing available services, constitutes their unequivocal acceptance of these
                                    Terms and any amendments thereto. For Customers accessing the Platform on behalf of an entity,

                                    The Customer is solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of their login
                                    credentials, including their username, password, and any other information necessary to access
                                    their account on the Platform. It is the Customer's duty to ensure that such credentials are not
                                    disclosed to any third party. The Customer is fully liable for all activities conducted under
                                    their account, whether authorized by them or not, including but not limited to unauthorized

                                    immediately notify the Company via the designated communication channels. UHS disclaims all
                                    liability for losses or damages incurred due to unauthorized account access or use resulting
                                    from the Customer's failure to secure their credentials. The Customer acknowledges that account
                                    security is paramount and agrees to implement best practices such as using strong passwords,
                                    regularly updating their credentials, and refraining from sharing their login details.

                                    11.1.2. UHS strongly encourages open communication between the Customer and the Professional to
                                    address and resolve issues amicably.

                                <p style="color:#000;">
                                    11.2.1. UHS may, at its sole discretion, provide mediation or facilitation services to assist in
                                    resolving disputes between the Customer and the Professional.
                                </p>

                                    11.2.3. UHS's role in mediation is purely advisory and does not include enforcing decisions,
                                    compelling either party to accept resolutions, or assuming liability for the outcome of the
                                    dispute.

                                    11.3.1. UHS is not a party to the service contract between the Customer and the Professional (in
                                    the case of independent contractors) and therefore does not bear liability for disputes arising

                                    11.3.2. UHS will not provide refunds, compensation, or other remedies for disputes unless
                                    explicitly stated in its policies or required by law.

                                    11.4.1. If a dispute cannot be resolved through direct communication or mediation, the Customer
                                    and the Professional are free to pursue legal remedies in accordance with applicable laws.
                                </p>

                                    between the Customer and the Professional.
                                </p>

                                    11.5.1. Customers are encouraged to report disputes or concerns to UHS through the designated
                                    support channels on the Platform. UHS will review the matter and determine whether mediation or
                                    further assistance can be provided.
                                </p>
